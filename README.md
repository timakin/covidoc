# Covidoc 

Covidoc is a website that allows users to view only links to reliable public and medical documents in order to prevent the information flooding that comes with the COVID-19 epidemic.
Our website is based on the Google Spreadsheet, so anyone can add a link from that sheet.
I am publishing this site with the hope that we can make a calm and quick effort to support each other without inadvertently panicking.
